LEARNINGS

    the best practice in mocking is to test it first (and observe the app's behavior) in the deployed app before "mocking"/replicating the actions in mockoon.

    in mockoon, we are in control of the responses. thus, it is best to learn first the appropriate response before mocking.

CONFLICTS

    after updating, application immediately redirected to auth/login, hence not finding 'xpath://select[@id='ticketPrice1']'
