LEARNINGS

    the codes must be comprehensible even by non-programmers, hence using high-level language. another aim to coding in a high-level language is to lessen the complexity of the code for the quality assurance team.

    ctrl + shift + f = global search
        especially useful whenever tasked to work on a new and unknown code/ticket/tests

    use of slugs
        the main ID (one that increments) is different from slugs (one that users can see in the URI). slugs are similar to usernames but are mainly used as a unique identifier to an entry.

CONFLICTS

    robot keyword cannot be identified
    solution: "Library <file path where function is declared>"
    feedback: okay lang as long as it works
    improvement: (personal) do it like <file name>.<function name>
