CONFLICTS

    if 301 route is the only route available, it will trigger an infinite loop

    there should be two routes to be triggered before and after POST
    
    solution (what i did):
    1. add another response in the same route
    2. change the response body
    3. add rules (is_edited=true)

solution: [Mockoon - Responses and rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDGeslYAEAc)
